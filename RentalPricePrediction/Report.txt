This project involves a comprehensive analysis of a real estate dataset obtained from
Immoscout24, focusing on rental properties in Germany. The study encompasses four distinct
phases: essential data preprocessing tasks, regression for predicting total rent, classification to
categorize rent as high or low, and clustering to identify property patterns. The dataset,
collected at three time points, includes critical property attributes and text descriptions.
Through regression, the project seeks to understand factors influencing rental pricing, while
clustering and classification aim to uncover patterns and categorize properties based on
similarities. The data preprocessing phase ensures dataset readiness for analysis by handling
missing values and encoding variables. This holistic approach provides valuable insights into
rental dynamics, property segmentation, and correlations between features, offering actionable
intelligence for real estate market stakeholders.
