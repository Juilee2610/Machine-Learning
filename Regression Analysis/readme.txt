**Summary: Exploring Regression Analysis and Feature Selection Techniques**

This report provides an overview of the analysis conducted on the 'Carseat.csv' dataset aimed at predicting sales of child car seats using various regression models and feature selection techniques. The analysis encompasses simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, and polynomial regression, along with feature selection using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Random Forest.

**Dataset Description:**
The 'Carseat.csv' dataset comprises both qualitative and quantitative features along with the dependent variable 'Sales' recorded across 400 locations. The dataset serves as the basis for predicting sales through regression modeling.

**Tasks Undertaken:**

1. **Regression Analysis:**
   - Simple Linear Regression: Analyzed the relationship between individual predictors and sales.
   - Multiple Linear Regression: Investigated the combined effect of multiple predictors on sales.
   - Polynomial Regression: Examined higher-order polynomial relationships between predictors and sales.

2. **Feature Selection:**
   - Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Explored dimensionality reduction technique to identify significant features affecting sales.
   - Random Forest: Employed ensemble learning method to discern the importance of features in predicting sales.

**Methodology:**
- All numerical values were displayed with 3-digit decimal precision for clarity and accuracy.
- Matplotlib plots were formatted with x-label, y-label, grid, title, and legend (where applicable), utilizing the 'seaborn-whitegrid' style for consistency.
- The 'random_state' parameter was set to 5805 for reproducibility as required.
